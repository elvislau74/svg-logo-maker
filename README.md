  ## Description

  In this project, we had to understand and utilize polymorphism by creating parent and child class constructors in order to perform Test-Driven  Development (TDD), as well as practice more with using Inquirer and writing to a file.

  ## Installation

  In order to use this file, you must download Node.js onto your computer. It is recommended that v16 (up to v18) is downloaded so that the app is able to run correctly. After opening the program in vscode, the user must then install the Inquirer and Jest packages by entering the two following commands into the terminal: 'npm i inquirer@8.2.4' and 'npm i jest --save' (do not include the quotation marks).


  ## Usage

  As shown in the video below, to start the program to produce a SVG Logo, you must first type into the terminal 'node.index', after which you will be prompted on the text, text color, shape, and shape color of your Logo. After all those questions are answered, you will be able to find your generated logo in the examples folder.
